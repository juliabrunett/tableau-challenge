# NYC Citi Bike Analysis:
This project involved extracting *NYC Citi Bike datasets* from [Citi Bike](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and using Tableau to visualize and determine answers to company leadership questions. The data was extracted from this [website](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data), cleaned and transformed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and Pandas, and pushed out to a combined csv to then load into Tableau. The datasets used are not included in this folder due to storage space, but can be downloaded from the [website](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) directly, if you would like to replicate this project for your own analysis.
